## Contributions

If you're planning to contribute, please keep public methods accepting the arguments as they currently do, in the manor and order in which they currently accept them. If you have a very good reason to modify them outside of these parameters, let me know why, what improvements could be made, etc.

Private methods can be changed, added, reordered, removed as you like, but make certain that it's as stable as you can make it before submitting a pull request and contributing.
